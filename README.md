# WebAutomationFramewok

This is a simple web automation framework built with IntelliJ/Selenium/Maven.

The framework is explained in details in **Mastering Selenium WebDriver 3.0** book available [here](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-selenium-webdriver-30-second-edition).

The framework utilizes the standard Page Object Model pattern in Selenium, so there are empty `pages` and `tests` folders to save page objects and classes containing **@Test** annotations.

All required dependencies and plugins are added to `pom.xml` file, so the prerequisites for using the framework is having **IntelliJ** with **Maven** plugins.

Detailed descriptions are added as comment blocks in each file.
